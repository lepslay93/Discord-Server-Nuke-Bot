# Discord Server Nuke Bot
## Made by AmNobCop
* Cybernetic is currently the **FASTEST** and **FREE** open source self-hosted Discord nuke bot written in Discord.js that works. All commands are focused on nuking.

* If you need help or have any general questions, join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ZpkXb7j6RC)

The bot has been optimized to run as fast as possible. I have tried my best to ensure it does not get rate limited but there is still a chance it does. If you are seeing rate limiting logged in your console while using Cybernetic, it is simply because <ins>it runs too fast</ins>.

Node.js version v16.9.0 or higher is required if you are going to run the file from source code.

# IMPORTANT: 
* I do not take any responsibility over whatever you are going to do with this bot.
