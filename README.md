# Discord Server Nuke Bot
### Made by AmNobCop (Nob#8609)

# Information
* Cybernetic is currently the **FASTEST** and **FREE** open source self-hosted Discord nuke bot written in Discord.js that works. All commands are focused on nuking.
* The bot has been optimized to run as fast as possible. I have tried my best to ensure it does not get rate limited but there is still a chance it does. If you are seeing rate limiting logged in your console while using Cybernetic, it is simply because <ins>it runs too fast</ins>.
* Node.js version v16.9.0 or higher is required if you are going to run the file from source code.
